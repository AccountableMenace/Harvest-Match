### SPACEnjoyers teams' project for NASA's Space Apps Challenge on data-driven crop yield optimization using soil moisture index assimilation and AI modelling.

# High-Level Summary

Our project aims to make soil moisture data accessible and easy to understand for new farmers. Recognizing the lack of readily available Earth Observation data, we developed an intuitive app for smartphone and desktop users. Farmers can select an area to receive insights on the best crops to plant, associated costs, and expected profits. We utilize five years of data from NASA's SMAP and ESA's Sentinel-2 satellites in order to provide accurate estimation for the best monetary yielding crop based on the given farm plot. The app combines satellite data to create a historical soil moisture profile and employs a machine learning model to predict soil moisture and optimal crop yields for the upcoming year. Our Best Monetary Yielding Selection Algorithm ranks crops based on profitability while considering soil moisture and regional market data. Additionally, users can upload lab results for precise soil analysis, allowing for tailored recommendations based on specific soil profiles. Ultimately, our project provides actionable insights that help farmers make informed crop decisions, particularly beneficial for beginners. It promotes sustainable practices by aligning crop suggestions with natural moisture levels and is designed for simplicity, making it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds. By harnessing satellite data and AI, we empower farmers to maximize profitability while encouraging efficient resource use.

# Project Details
Our project aims to predict the best monetary yielding crop for an area by analyzing soil moisture levels and other important factors. To be able to do this, we collect data from NASA's SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite and ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite spanning five years. We pay particular attention to Bands 8 (near-infrared) and 12 (shortwave infrared), which are utilized to compute the Soil Moisture Index (SMI). Based on the soil and water requirements of the crops, this information aids in selecting appropriate crops.
